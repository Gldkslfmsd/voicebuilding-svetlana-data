3277.544000	sx439 That stinging vapor was caused by chloride vaporization. 	3286.024000
3286.304000	sx440 The advertising verse of Plymouth Variety Store never changes. 	3295.888000
3296.160000	sx441 Don't look for group valuables in a bank vault. 	3302.744000
3303.024000	sx442 Suburban housewives often suffer from the gab habit. 	3309.424000
3309.704000	sx443 A lone star shone in the early evening sky. 	3316.464000
3316.744000	sx444 The toddler found a clamshell near the camp site. 	3323.664000
3323.944000	sx445 What is this large thing by the ironing board? 	3331.864000
3332.144000	sx446 Thomas thinks a larger clamp solves the problem. 	3338.408000
3338.680000	sx447 First add milk to the shredded cheese. 	3344.464000
3344.744000	sx448 Spherical gifts are difficult to wrap. 	3351.304000
3351.584000	sx449 Ralph prepared red snapper with fresh lemon sauce for dinner. 	3359.128000
3359.400000	sx450 Roy ignored the spurious data points in drawing the graph. 	3366.984000
3367.264000	sx451 The thick elm forest was nearly overwhelmed by Dutch Elm Disease. 	3373.984000
3374.264000	sx452 In developing film, many toxic chemicals are used. 	3382.384000
3382.664000	si453 Everything went real smooth, the sheriff said. 	3388.904000
3389.184000	si454 If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something to the economy, he said. 	3396.928000
3397.200000	si455 One validated acts of school districts. 	3403.864000
3414.280000	si457 Both figures would go higher in later years. 	3421.968000
3422.240000	si458 This is not a program of socialized medicine. 	3428.808000
3438.720000	si460 Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation. 	3447.984000
3448.264000	si461 Day after day some new episode is reported. 	3454.944000
3455.224000	si462 It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories. 	3464.048000
3464.320000	si463 The hotel owner shrugged. 	3469.624000
3469.904000	si464 The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor. 	3476.864000
3477.144000	si465 Nobody really expects to evacuate. 	3484.808000
3485.080000	si466 Then we'd really have someplace to go. 	3492.144000
3492.424000	si467 He really crucified him; he nailed it for a yard loss. 	3499.784000
3500.064000	si468 There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee. 	3507.624000
3517.840000	si470 A quick touchdown resulted. 	3524.064000
3524.344000	si471 Suddenly my reflexes are gone. 	3530.344000
3530.624000	si472 He played basketball there while working toward a law degree. 	3539.248000
3539.520000	si473 Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors. 	3546.688000
3546.960000	si474 The golfing fathers ruled in his favor. 	3554.528000
3554.800000	si475 They will take a wedding trip later. 	3561.264000
3561.544000	si476 So, if anybody solicits by phone, make sure you mail the dough to the above. 	3572.776000
3573.048000	si477 Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director. 	3583.760000
3584.032000	si478 The job also covers a number of other items. 	3592.384000
3592.656000	si479 The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction. 	3603.744000
3604.016000	si480 Range was a vital detail. 	3609.800000
3610.072000	si481 This, he added, brought about petty jealousies and petty personal grievances. 	3621.424000
3621.696000	si482 There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources. 	3630.680000
3630.952000	si483 The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles. 	3640.504000
3640.776000	si484 The family requests that flowers be omitted. 	3647.824000
3648.096000	si485 Both cars were slightly damaged. 	3652.960000
3653.232000	si486 It was time to go up myself. 	3659.600000
3659.872000	si487 "Cable confirmation", it said translated. 	3667.480000
3683.888000	si489 We must be ready for any needed sacrifice. 	3690.672000
3690.944000	si490 Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected. 	3700.616000
3700.888000	si491 Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income. 	3712.728000
3728.400000	si493 Unfortunately, there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower. 	3738.224000
3738.504000	si494 Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer. 	3746.928000
3747.200000	si495 They either walked or were driven. 	3756.008000
3756.280000	si496 They could walk, ride on a bus or be driven. 	3763.504000
3763.784000	si497 Displayed as lamps, the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent. 	3774.744000
3775.016000	si498 To create such a lamp, order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop. 	3783.528000
3783.800000	si499 The scalloped edge is particularly appealing. 	3791.448000
3791.720000	si500 There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series. 	3805.264000
3805.536000	si501 But this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting, if not great, film. 	3813.304000
3813.576000	si502 And you think you have language problems. 	3819.840000
3820.112000	si503 Very austere yet racy. 	3825.904000
3846.728000	si505 This excellent foreign bomb takes only six. 	3854.592000
3854.864000	si506 They polished the windshield. 	3860.592000
3860.864000	si507 Ideally, he knew, it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels. 	3872.096000
3872.368000	si508 Mollusks are a case in point. 	3879.080000
3879.360000	si509 This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated. 	3889.280000
3889.560000	si510 Adequate compensation is indispensable. 	3897.240000
3897.520000	si511 This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure. 	3907.720000
3908.000000	si512 It was most effective against trade unions. 	3914.560000
3914.840000	si513 This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer. 	3921.456000
3921.728000	si514 You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize. 	3928.200000
3939.536000	si516 Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town. 	3949.120000
3949.392000	si517 Confusion became chaos; each succeeding day brought new acts of violence. 	3958.136000
3967.376000	si519 That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates. 	3978.032000
3978.304000	si520 Success, for many turnpikes, has come hard. 	3986.016000
3986.296000	si521 Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates. 	3996.784000
3997.064000	si522 Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes. 	4007.312000
4007.584000	si523 Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts. 	4016.312000
4016.584000	si524 Within a system, however, the autonomy of each member library is preserved. 	4025.136000
4025.416000	si525 The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life. 	4034.232000
4034.504000	si526 We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation. 	4043.632000
4043.904000	si527 The boost is helpful but inadequate. 	4051.816000
4052.096000	si528 Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines. 	4063.288000
4063.560000	si529 Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved. 	4071.064000
4071.344000	si530 His election, on the other hand, would unquestionably strengthen the regulars. 	4079.808000
4080.080000	si531 He spoke briefly, sensibly, to the point and without oratorical flourishes. 	4089.328000
4089.600000	si532 Further, it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned. 	4099.568000
4099.840000	si533 Fools, he bayed, what do you think you are doing? 	4108.024000
4108.304000	si534 He earnestly urged a cease-fire. 	4115.448000
4115.720000	si535 Too many have bogged down in bickering. 	4122.144000
4131.120000	si537 It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed. 	4142.544000
4142.824000	si538 County officials have cooperated consistently. 	4150.168000
4150.448000	si539 But that heritage is shrinking even faster. 	4158.224000
4158.504000	si540 Thus there is a clearer division of authority, administrative and legislative. 	4168.640000
4168.912000	si541 It helps those people who help themselves. 	4176.296000
4176.576000	si542 She came back the other day to reassure me. 	4184.416000
4184.696000	si543 Jokes, cartoons and cynics to the contrary, mothers-in-law make good friends. 	4195.392000
4195.672000	si544 Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards. 	4202.768000
4203.048000	si545 But how little love we give him! 	4212.008000
4212.288000	si546 The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure. 	4224.736000
4225.016000	si547 Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day? 	4233.936000
4234.216000	si548 Never happier in my life. 	4239.896000
4240.176000	si549 These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully. 	4251.048000
4251.320000	si550 You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year. 	4261.720000
4261.992000	si551 Is the mother of an autistic child at fault? 	4269.680000
4269.952000	si552 We think differently. 	4274.936000
4275.216000	si553 As a rule, the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others. 	4284.336000
4284.616000	si554 Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick. 	4295.336000
4295.616000	si555 Only ingenuity will uncover it. 	4301.816000
4302.096000	si556 We did not accept the diagnosis at once, but gradually we are coming to. 	4310.896000
4311.176000	si557 How do they turn out later? 	4316.760000
4317.032000	si558 Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits? 	4325.360000
4325.632000	si559 They seem darned proud of it. 	4331.160000
4331.432000	si560 Where only one club existed before, he says, two will flourish henceforth. 	4342.024000
4342.304000	si561 This is going to be a language lesson, and you can master it in a few minutes. 	4352.424000
4352.704000	si562 Family loyalties and cooperative work have been unbroken for generations. 	4362.584000
4362.864000	si563 Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette. 	4373.008000
4373.288000	si564 Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights. 	4382.528000
4382.808000	si565 Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes. 	4392.568000
4392.848000	si566 Contrast trim provides other touches of color. 	4400.304000
4400.584000	si567 At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light, but crisp texture. 	4412.552000
4412.824000	si568 At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather. 	4421.792000
4422.064000	si569 Most of us brush our teeth by hand. 	4429.752000
4430.024000	si570 The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel. 	4440.272000
4440.544000	si571 "Steam baths" writes: do steam baths have any health value? 	4451.088000
4451.368000	si572 "Sewing brings numbness" writes: what makes my hands numb when sewing? 	4461.248000
4461.528000	si573 Teaching guides are included with each record. 	4469.528000
4469.808000	si574 It motivates his behavior. 	4474.848000
4475.128000	si575 He doesn't want her to look frowningly at him, or speak to him angrily. 	4485.504000
4485.776000	si576 But even mother's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior. 	4496.304000
4496.576000	si577 She can decrease the number of temptations. 	4504.448000
4504.720000	si578 She can remove all knick-knacks within reach. 	4513.504000
4513.776000	si579 Usually, they titter loudly after they have passed by. 	4523.888000
4524.160000	si580 Too often, unless he hails them, they pass him by. 	4533.784000
4534.056000	si581 Say he is a horse thief, runs an old adage. 	4544.600000
4557.416000	si583 This we can sympathetically understand. 	4564.440000
4564.720000	si584 This is taxation without representation. 	4570.856000
4571.136000	si585 Our entire economy will have a terrific uplift. 	4578.096000
4578.376000	si586 One even gave my little dog a biscuit. 	4585.360000
4585.640000	si587 Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a ghost town. 	4593.936000
4594.216000	si588 Why do we need bigger and better bombs? 	4600.680000
4600.960000	si589 One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea. 	4612.272000
4621.440000	si591 Replace it with the statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators. 	4633.096000
4633.368000	si592 Who wants this deed done? 	4640.016000
4640.288000	si593 The gallant half-city is dying on its feet. 	4648.032000
4648.312000	si594 The trial balloons are afloat. 	4654.752000
4666.520000	si596 On these they feel they can rely. 	4674.504000
4674.784000	si597 The moment of truth is the moment of crisis. 	4682.304000
4682.584000	si598 New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones. 	4695.752000
4696.024000	si599 What explains this uni-directional paralysis? 	4704.112000
4704.384000	si600 Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad. 	4715.000000
